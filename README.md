## About

Uncle Iroh is the wise mentor on the amazing TV show, Avatar: The Last Airbender. He is my favorite character because of his wise quotes, easy-going nature, and love of tea. 

I built this website for two reasons:
<ol>
    <li>Aggregate my favorite Uncle Iroh quotes</li>
    <li>Practice using HTML and CSS, particularly using CSS Grids to build a mobile-first, responsive UI.</li>
</ol>
